# Stock-Analysis

## Overview
  
  Steve's parents are interested in investing in Green Energy, and are currently invested in DAQO Green Energy. Steve has assembled an excel file of other green energy stocks, as well as DAQO, for 2017 and 2018. Steve's parent's believe the more actively stock is traded, the more likely it is to accurately reflect the value of the stock. Therefore, we have analyzed the stock tickers by both determining their percent return (the ratio of the price of stock at the end of the year to the price of stock at the beginning of the year quantity minus one) and their annual volume. Stocks with both the greatest volume and the greatest return, would be the best investment opportunity for Steve's parents.
